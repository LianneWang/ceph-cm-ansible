### This standalone playbook can be used to prep a COBBLER-IMAGED testnode
### so that it can be used to capture an OS image for FOG.
### This playbook is needed for a couple reasons
###   - NIC configs get hard coded into the captured FOG images so nodes reimaged by FOG don't come up with network

- hosts:
    - testnodes
  become: true
  tasks:

  # The machine used to *capture* the trusty image gets its MAC addresses hard coded in any subsequent cloned machines
